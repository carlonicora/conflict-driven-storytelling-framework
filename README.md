# Conflict-Driven Storytelling Framework

## Goals and Objectives

The Conflict-Driven Storytelling Framework aims to help storytellers create engaging narratives, enhance player agency, and improve their storytelling skills. The framework is designed to provide guidance on various aspects of storytelling, such as character development, worldbuilding, and pacing, with a focus on conflict as a driving force for the narrative.

## Who is it for

This framework is intended for game masters, writers, and anyone interested in improving their storytelling abilities in collaborative settings. Whether you're running a tabletop RPG, writing interactive fiction, or working on any project that involves collaborative storytelling, the Conflict-Driven Storytelling Framework can offer valuable insights and guidance.

## How to use the framework

To get the most out of the framework, start by reading the chapters in order. Each chapter covers a different aspect of storytelling, and they are designed to build upon each other. However, you can also refer to specific chapters based on your needs and interests. The framework is meant to be flexible and adaptable to various storytelling contexts, so feel free to use it in the way that works best for you.
