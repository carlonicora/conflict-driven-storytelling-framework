## 8. Reflecting on the Game

Reflecting on the game is a vital part of being a successful game master. It allows you to learn from your experiences, make adjustments to the game, and improve your storytelling and game management skills. Here are some aspects to consider when reflecting on your game:

1. **Consider player feedback**: Create an open and supportive environment where players feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Encourage them to provide feedback on what they enjoyed or struggled with during the game. This feedback can help you identify areas for improvement and tailor the game to better suit your players' interests. 
2. **Review and adjust plot points**: Assess how well the plot points worked in the context of the game, and consider how players' choices may have impacted the story. Make adjustments to plot points, if necessary, to ensure they align with the unfolding story and continue to provide engaging challenges for your players. Offer examples of potential adjustments, such as introducing new plot points, modifying existing ones, or removing plot points that no longer serve the narrative. 
3. **Analyze your performance as a game master**: Reflect on your abilities as a storyteller and game manager. Ask yourself specific questions about your performance, such as how well you maintained the pacing, engaged players, or adapted to unexpected situations. Use these insights to identify areas where you can improve and grow as a game master. 
4. **Assess the impact of players' choices**: Evaluate how player choices have shaped the story and the game world. Consider if their actions had meaningful consequences and if the game world responded to their decisions in a realistic and engaging manner. Use this assessment to inform future game sessions and ensure that the players' choices continue to have a significant impact on the story.

By regularly reflecting on your game, you can become a more effective game master, create more engaging experiences for your players, and foster a more enjoyable and rewarding gaming environment for everyone involved.

### 8.1. A wish and a rose: an approach to players' feedback

In the Conflict-Driven Storytelling Framework, incorporating players' feedback is crucial for refining and enhancing the gaming experience. One effective way to gather feedback is through the "A wish and a rose" approach. This method fosters open communication and a positive gaming environment by encouraging players to share their thoughts with the game master after each session.

The "A wish and a rose" method is implemented by having the game master ask each player to provide a wish and give a rose to another player after every session. This process should encourage open-ended discussion rather than close-ended answers, providing each player with a platform for thinking out loud. The comments offered by the players serve as essential feedback for the game master, informing how the game evolves and improves over time.

1.  **A Wish**: Players express their desires for future game sessions, suggesting improvements or requesting specific elements they would like to experience. Wishes help the game master understand players' preferences, which can then be used to tailor the game accordingly.
2.  **A Rose**: Players highlight positive aspects of the game session, such as memorable moments or enjoyable interactions. Roses enable the game master to identify what works well and build on those successes.

The "A wish and a rose" approach aligns with the collaborative nature of the Conflict-Driven Storytelling Framework, ensuring that the narrative evolves based on the players' input. By maintaining open dialogue and understanding their needs and desires, game masters and players can work together to create an engaging and satisfying gaming experience.

### 8.2. Reviewing and Adjusting Plot Points

As a storyteller, it is crucial to analyze the outcomes of each game session and make necessary adjustments to the plot points for future sessions. This practical approach ensures that the story remains engaging and responsive to the players' actions and choices.

To effectively review and adjust plot points based on the players' actions:

1.  Recap the events of the previous session, focusing on the players' decisions and the consequences of their actions. Identify any significant deviations from your original plot points, such as players choosing to side with the dragon instead of saving the princess.
2.  Determine the impact of these deviations on the story's direction and evaluate whether your existing plot points need to be altered or replaced. Be prepared to adjust your plans to accommodate the players' choices and maintain narrative coherence.
3.  Develop new plot points, if necessary, that reflect the players' actions and decisions from the previous session. Consider how these updated plot points can create engaging new challenges and opportunities for the players in the upcoming session.

By regularly reviewing and adjusting plot points based on the players' actions, you can ensure that your story remains engaging, dynamic, and tailored to the unique experiences and preferences of your players. This approach not only makes for a more immersive game but also empowers players to feel that their choices have a meaningful impact on the unfolding narrative.

### 8.3. Learning from Successes and Challenges

As a storyteller, it is crucial to reflect on the successes and challenges you encounter while running your game. This introspection helps you grow as a game master, refining your skills and deepening your understanding of your players' preferences and playstyles.

To effectively learn from your successes and challenges, consider the following steps:

1.  Keep a log of each scene, noting its type (feel, decide, act) and the corresponding plot point (Need-go, go-search, search-find, find-take, take-return, return-change). Record the highlights and low points of each scene, detailing moments when players were immersed in the story, engaging encounters that tested their skills, or instances where the players seemed disengaged or confused.
2.  Analyze the factors that contributed to these successes and challenges. Consider aspects such as pacing, encounter design, or player motivation. For example, if a combat encounter was particularly engaging, examine what made it so, such as a unique enemy, interesting terrain, or challenging mechanics.
3.  Apply the lessons learned from these experiences to future sessions. For example, if a particular encounter was too difficult or confusing for your players, consider adjusting the difficulty or providing more clarity in future encounters. Alternatively, if a roleplaying scene resonated with the players, strive to incorporate similar moments in upcoming sessions.

By reviewing your log of scenes and their outcomes, you can identify patterns and trends, enabling you to avoid making the same mistakes when creating similar scenes in the future. This continuous improvement process will ensure that your game remains engaging, enjoyable, and tailored to the unique needs and preferences of your players.

In conclusion, by maintaining a log and actively reflecting on your successes and challenges, you can continuously improve as a storyteller, ultimately creating a more immersive and enjoyable experience for your players.

### 8.4. Improving as a Storyteller

Improving as a storyteller is an ongoing process that requires commitment, reflection, and practice. By consistently evaluating your performance and seeking feedback from your players, you can refine your skills and enhance your ability to create engaging, immersive experiences for your players.

To improve as a storyteller, consider the following tips:

1.  Foster open communication with your players: Encourage your players to provide feedback on the story, pacing, encounters, and any other aspects of the game. Use this feedback to adapt your storytelling approach and better cater to your players' preferences.
2.  Observe and learn from other game masters: Attend game sessions or watch online streams to gain insights into different storytelling styles, techniques, and methods of engaging players. Adopt and adapt elements that resonate with your own style.
3.  Deepen your understanding of narrative structure: Study storytelling resources to learn about plot development, character arcs, and world-building. Apply these concepts to your own games to create more engaging and immersive stories.
4.  Hone your improvisational skills: Develop your ability to adapt and respond to unexpected player choices or situations by practicing improvisational exercises or participating in improvisational theater workshops.
5.  Reflect and grow from past experiences: Regularly review your sessions, noting what worked well and what could be improved. Use this information to refine your storytelling approach and enhance your skills over time.

By focusing on these specific areas, you can continuously improve as a storyteller and provide increasingly enjoyable and engaging experiences for your players.
