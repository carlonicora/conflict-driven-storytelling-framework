## 4. The Story Circle: A Flexible Story Structure

The Story Circle is a versatile narrative structure that can help storytellers create engaging and dynamic stories for roleplaying games. Developed by Dan Harmon, the Story Circle is inspired by Joseph Campbell's concept of the Hero's Journey, a monomyth that describes the archetypal narrative pattern found in countless stories across cultures and time. Harmon adapted the Hero's Journey into a simplified eight-stage structure that lends itself well to various storytelling mediums, including television, film, and novels.

The Story Circle consists of eight distinct stages that guide characters through a circular journey of growth and transformation. 

To adapt the Story Circle for roleplaying games, it's essential to consider the unique aspects of collaborative storytelling and player agency. In the following sections, we'll explore each stage of the Story Circle in detail and provide guidance on tailoring it to the needs of your roleplaying game.

By understanding the principles of the Story Circle and adapting it to the interactive nature of roleplaying games, you can create immersive and engaging stories that provide satisfying arcs for both individual characters and the overarching narrative.

### 4.1. Breaking Down the Story Circle

The Story Circle is a circular narrative structure that follows eight key stages, guiding characters through a transformative journey. These stages are designed to create a satisfying story arc, fostering character development and engaging audiences. In this section, we'll break down each stage of the Story Circle to better understand its role in storytelling.

To fully understand and apply the Story Circle to your roleplaying game, it's essential to delve deeper into the significance of each stage and how they contribute to the narrative arc. Here, we break down each stage and provide examples to help illustrate the concepts:

1. **You (Establish a protagonist):** Introduce the main character(s) and provide context for their place in the world. This stage is crucial for establishing an emotional connection between the players and their characters. _Example: A young wizard leaves their small village to study at a renowned magical academy._ 
2. **Need (Identify a need or desire):** Present a challenge, desire, or goal that motivates the character to embark on their journey. This stage sets the direction for the story and provides an impetus for the characters to take action. _Example: The wizard discovers an ancient prophecy that could endanger their world._ 
3. **Go (The protagonist enters an unfamiliar situation):** The character steps out of their comfort zone and faces new challenges or experiences. This stage often involves a physical, emotional, or spiritual departure from the familiar. _Example: The wizard and their allies set out on a quest to find a mysterious artifact that could help them avert the prophecy._ 
4. **Search (The protagonist adapts to the new situation):** As the character navigates the unfamiliar situation, they learn, grow, and adapt to overcome challenges. This stage is essential for character development and showcases the character's resilience and resourcefulness. _Example: The wizard learns to harness new magical abilities and forms strong bonds with their allies._ 
5. **Find (The protagonist finds what they were looking for):** The character achieves their goal or gains the knowledge they were seeking. This stage marks a turning point in the story and often leads to a shift in the character's perspective. _Example: The wizard locates the artifact and learns about its hidden power._ 
6. **Take (The protagonist pays a price for their discovery):** The character experiences consequences, sacrifices, or hardships as a result of their actions or discoveries. This stage highlights the cost of the character's journey and adds emotional weight to the story. _Example: The wizard's newfound power attracts dangerous enemies, putting their allies at risk._ 
7. **Return (The protagonist returns to their familiar situation):** The character returns to their starting point or a familiar environment, often bringing with them newfound knowledge or power. This stage provides a sense of closure and allows the character to reflect on their journey. *Example: The wizard returns to the magical academy,prepared to confront the threat posed by the prophecy.*
8. **Change (The protagonist is changed by the experience):** The character undergoes a transformation as a result of their journey, often becoming wiser, stronger, or more self-aware. This stage signifies the completion of the character's arc and demonstrates the lasting impact of their experiences. _Example: The wizard, now a more confident and powerful mage, embraces their role as a protector of their world and vows to continue honing their skills._

By understanding the significance of each stage and incorporating them into your roleplaying game, you can create a compelling and engaging narrative structure that drives the story forward and promotes character growth. Remember that the Story Circle is a flexible framework that can be adapted to fit your unique story and character arcs.

### 4.2. Adapting the Story Circle for Roleplaying Games

In a roleplaying game setting, the Story Circle can be a powerful tool for creating engaging and dynamic adventures. However, it's important to note that RPGs often involve multiple player characters and an open-ended, player-driven narrative. As such, some adjustments need to be made to adapt the Story Circle for use in an RPG context.

1. **Multiple Character Arcs:** In RPGs, there are typically several player characters, each with their own unique backgrounds, motivations, and arcs. As a result, it's essential to consider how the Story Circle can be adapted to accommodate multiple character arcs. You can create a "collective" Story Circle that takes into account the overarching narrative and the individual character arcs, while still maintaining a cohesive story. For example, the main plot could revolve around a group of adventurers working together to defeat a powerful villain, with each character experiencing their own personal trials and growth along the way.
2. **Player Agency:** One of the key aspects of RPGs is player agency, which allows players to make decisions that shape the narrative. To accommodate this, the Story Circle should be flexible enough to adapt to the choices players make. This may involve adjusting plot points, altering the order of events, or even creating entirely new story elements in response to player actions. For instance, if players choose to pursue a side quest instead of following the main plot, the Story Circle should be adaptable enough to incorporate this new direction and still maintain a cohesive narrative.
3. **Non-Linear Progression:** Unlike traditional storytelling, RPGs can feature non-linear progression, with players exploring different storylines and subplots at their discretion. In such cases, the Story Circle can be broken down into smaller circles for each subplot, which can be interwoven with the main narrative. For example, if the main plot involves stopping a dark wizard, smaller story circles could be created for side quests involving rescuing kidnapped villagers, uncovering a hidden artifact, or forging alliances with other factions.
4. **Shared Storytelling:** In RPGs, storytelling is a collaborative effort between the game master (GM) and the players. The Story Circle can serve as a guide for both parties, helping the GM create engaging adventures and allowing players to understand their characters' roles within the narrative. Encourage players to contribute their ideas and build upon the story, enriching the overall experience for everyone involved.
5. **Dynamic Encounters and Challenges:** The Story Circle's stages can be used to create dynamic encounters and challenges that keep players engaged and invested in the story. For example, the 'road of trials' stage could involve a series of combat encounters, puzzles, or social challenges that test the characters' abilities and push them to grow. The challenges should vary in difficulty and complexity, ensuring that players feel a sense of accomplishment and growth as they progress through the story.
6. **Handling Character Death or Retirement:** In RPGs, character death or retirement can be an inevitable part of the experience. When this occurs, the Story Circle should be adaptable enough to incorporate these changes into the narrative. New characters can be introduced, and their personal arcs can be woven into the existing story, allowing the narrative to continue smoothly.

By making these adjustments to the Story Circle, you can create a flexible and dynamic story structure that is well-suited for the unique challenges and opportunities presented by roleplaying games.

### 4.3. Story Circle for Different Lengths and Styles

The Story Circle can be easily adapted for various lengths and styles of roleplaying games. Whether you are running a one-shot session, a short adventure, an epic campaign spanning multiple adventures, or even side plots, the Story Circle can provide a solid foundation for your storytelling. In this section, we will discuss how to adjust the Story Circle to accommodate different game lengths and styles, providing examples to illustrate the process.

**Campaigns:** In campaigns, overarching stories spanning multiple adventures, the Story Circle can be used to create a cohesive narrative structure. Each adventure within the campaign should have its own Story Circle, with the campaign's overall Story Circle tying them together. The individual adventures should contribute to the campaign's overall theme, culminating in a satisfying resolution. For example, a campaign centered around a powerful artifact might have adventures focused on finding, protecting, and eventually destroying the artifact.

>[!EXAMPLE]
>Imagine a campaign called "The Rise and Fall of the Shadow Empire," where the player characters uncover an ancient evil empire's resurrection plot and strive to thwart its nefarious plans. This campaign spans several years of in-game time, with multiple adventures and side plots along the way. Here's a breakdown of the Story Circle for this campaign:
>
>1.  **You:** The player characters are part of a small adventuring party exploring a newly discovered ancient ruin. They are comfortable in their roles as treasure hunters and have little knowledge of the larger world beyond their immediate surroundings.
>2. **Need:** While exploring the ruin, the characters discover an ancient artifact and learn of the Shadow Empire's plan to return to power. They realize that they must take up the responsibility of stopping this impending threat.
>3. **Go:** The characters decide to leave their familiar lives as treasure hunters and embark on a journey to uncover the secrets of the Shadow Empire, seeking allies and resources to aid them in their quest.
>4. **Search:** Over the years, the characters face numerous challenges as they delve deeper into the Shadow Empire's history, confront its agents, and unravel the conspiracy. They navigate political intrigue, fight epic battles, and grow in power and wisdom as they travel across the realm.
>5. **Find:** The characters eventually discover the location of the Shadow Empire's hidden stronghold and the true nature of its power source. They also learn of a potential way to weaken the empire and prevent its return.
>6. **Take:** Armed with this knowledge, the characters confront the Shadow Empire's leaders and their powerful minions, suffering losses and setbacks in the process. They must ultimately decide how far they are willing to go and the sacrifices they are prepared to make to save the realm.
>7. **Return:** After a climactic battle, the characters manage to thwart the Shadow Empire's plans, saving the realm from its evil grip. They return to their former lives but are forever changed by their experiences, now recognized as heroes and leaders in their own right.
>8. **Change:** As the characters settle into their new roles, they use the lessons learned from their journey to help build a better future for the realm. They remain vigilant, knowing that the world will always need heroes to face the unknown challenges ahead.

While the Story Circle provides a solid foundation for a campaign's plot, it's crucial to recognize that player agency plays a significant role in shaping the narrative. The initial Story Circle serves as an overarching framework, outlining the general progression of the story. However, as the campaign unfolds, the players' actions, choices, and decisions will inevitably impact the plot in various ways.

It's essential for the game master (GM) to be flexible and adaptive to these changes. The GM should always be prepared to modify the plot and adjust the Story Circle accordingly as the players make choices that deviate from the original plan. This means that the Story Circle should be treated as a living document, constantly evolving to accommodate new developments in the story.

**Side Plots:** Side plots are long secondary plots that span multiple adventures, adding depth and richness to the main campaign by providing additional challenges and opportunities for character development. When incorporating side plots, create a separate Story Circle for each side plot, ensuring they complement and enhance the main campaign's narrative. For instance, a side plot involving a character's long-lost sibling can intersect with the main campaign when the sibling is discovered working for the campaign's main antagonist.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> For this example, let's create a side plot within the previously mentioned campaign, focusing on a specific character's personal journey. This side plot will tie into the main campaign, adding depth and complexity to the overall story.
> 
> **Side Plot: The Lost Heirloom**
> 
> **You**: The character, a skilled thief named Lila, learns of a precious heirloom that belonged to her family but was lost generations ago.
>**Need**: Lila becomes determined to recover the lost heirloom, believing it will help her understand her family's history and strengthen her connection to her ancestors.
>**Go**: Lila and her fellow adventurers embark on a quest to find clues and gather information about the heirloom's current whereabouts.
>**Search**: The group faces various obstacles and challenges, such as deciphering ancient riddles, navigating treacherous terrain, and encountering dangerous creatures guarding the heirloom's location.
>**Find**: Lila discovers the heirloom hidden in an ancient temple, guarded by a powerful magical creature. She realizes the heirloom possesses a unique magical power.
>**Take**: After a fierce battle with the guardian, Lila claims the heirloom. However, she discovers that taking the heirloom also awakens an ancient curse that now threatens her and her companions.
>**Return**: Lila and her party must find a way to break the curse while keeping the heirloom safe from the clutches of other interested parties, such as rival thieves or sinister factions.
>**Change**: Ultimately, Lila and her friends succeed in breaking the curse and securing the heirloom. Through this journey, Lila gains a deeper understanding of her heritage and grows as a character, having forged stronger bonds with her companions and learned the value of teamwork and trust.
>
>This side plot, while not directly tied to the main campaign's central conflict, adds depth to Lila's character and provides opportunities for the players to engage with the world and its lore. It also allows for the integration of new conflicts and challenges, enriching the overall campaign experience.

**Adventures:** Adventures typically span multiple sessions, with a self-contained narrative arc. When creating an adventure using the Story Circle, ensure the adventure's structure provides enough content for multiple sessions. Each step of the Story Circle can be expanded into multiple scenes or encounters, allowing players to experience a complete and satisfying story arc. In a dungeon-crawl adventure, for example, players might spend one session navigating traps and puzzles, another session battling dangerous creatures, and a final session confronting the dungeon's main antagonist.

>[!EXAMPLE]
>For this example, let's create an adventure within the previously mentioned campaign. The adventure will be a self-contained story arc that ties into the overarching plot and contributes to the campaign's overall narrative.
>
>**Adventure: The Cursed Village**
>
>**You**: The party of adventurers, including Lila and her companions, arrive in a small village plagued by mysterious events and misfortunes.
>**Need**: The villagers implore the adventurers to investigate the source of the curse and put an end to it, as their lives and livelihoods are at stake.
>**Go**: The party sets out to explore the surrounding area, where they find an ancient, abandoned fortress rumored to be the source of the curse.
>**Search**: As the adventurers delve deeper into the fortress, they face a series of trials, including deadly traps, menacing creatures, and puzzling riddles, testing their skills and wits.
>**Find**: The party discovers that a malevolent spirit, the vengeful ghost of a long-dead warlord, is responsible for the curse afflicting the village.
>**Take**: The adventurers confront the ghost and learn that the spirit seeks vengeance for an ancient betrayal by the village's ancestors. The party must decide whether to try and destroy the spirit or attempt to find a way to appease it and lift the curse.
>**Return**: The party chooses a course of action, either destroying the ghost or finding a way to make amends for the village's past actions. They return to the village, lifting the curse and restoring peace and prosperity.
>**Change**: Through this adventure, the characters develop a greater understanding of the world's history and the complexities of morality. They learn that actions have long-lasting consequences, and they grow closer as a team, having faced the challenges of the cursed fortress together.
>
>This adventure, while a self-contained story, ties into the main campaign by reinforcing themes of legacy, consequences, and moral complexity. It also provides opportunities for character development and growth, as well as introducing new conflicts and challenges that enrich the overall campaign experience.

**Sessions:** For single-session games, you may need to simplify the Story Circle to accommodate the limited timeframe. This can involve streamlining the narrative steps and focusing on the essential elements of the story. Each step of the Story Circle can be condensed into a single scene or encounter, allowing the story to unfold quickly and maintain player engagement throughout the session. In a single-session rescue mission, for instance, players might swiftly move through the steps of the Story Circle: receiving the mission, overcoming obstacles, rescuing the captive, and returning home to a hero's welcome.

>[!EXAMPLE]
>For this example, let's create a session within the previously mentioned adventure, "The Cursed Village." This session is a single play session that contributes to the larger story arc of the adventure.
>
>**Session: The Ghost's Riddle**
>
>**You**: Lila and her party, having made their way into the abandoned fortress, find themselves in a room with a locked door and an inscription on the wall.
>**Need**: The party must solve the riddle inscribed on the wall to unlock the door and progress further into the fortress in their quest to lift the curse from the village.
>**Go**: Lila and her companions examine the inscription and begin to debate its meaning, sharing their knowledge and perspectives to unravel the riddle's solution.
>**Search**: As the party attempts to solve the riddle, they must also contend with a series of magical traps and defenses triggered by incorrect guesses, forcing them to think carefully and work together.
>**Find**: The adventurers eventually decipher the riddle, revealing a hidden message from the vengeful ghost that provides valuable insight into the spirit's motivations and the events that led to the curse.
>**Take**: With the newfound understanding of the ghost's past, the party must decide how to approach the spirit, whether to use this information to negotiate with it or to prepare for a potentially dangerous confrontation.
>**Return**: The door unlocks, and the party proceeds further into the fortress, using their new knowledge to inform their approach to the ghost and the curse, building on the understanding they have gained.
>**Change**: Through the process of solving the riddle and learning more about the ghost's past, the characters develop a greater appreciation for the importance of cooperation and the power of knowledge in overcoming challenges.
>
>This session contributes to the larger adventure by providing a focused, puzzle-solving challenge that develops the characters' teamwork and problem-solving skills. It also enriches the overall narrative by revealing more about the ghost and its motivations, setting the stage for the adventure's climax and resolution.

When adapting the Story Circle for different game lengths and styles, it's essential to consider potential challenges and how to address them. For example, a long campaign might require more complex narrative arcs, while a side plot may need to be carefully woven into the main story to maintain cohesion. By understanding the unique requirements of each game type and being flexible in your storytelling approach, you can successfully use the Story Circle to create engaging and memorable roleplaying experiences for your players.

### 4.4 Weaving in Character Backstories and Personal Goals

Incorporating character backstories and personal goals into your campaign's plot can help create a more engaging and immersive experience for your players. By weaving these elements into the game, you show your players that their characters' histories and motivations matter, fostering a deeper connection to the story.

To weave character backstories and personal goals into the plot, follow these guidelines:

1.  **Familiarize yourself with the characters' backgrounds**: Be sure to understand the key elements of each character's backstory, including their family, upbringing, and significant events that shaped their lives.
2.  **Identify personal goals**: Work with your players to establish clear goals for their characters, such as avenging a loved one, achieving fame, or obtaining a powerful artifact.
3.  **Create plot hooks**: Develop plot hooks that tie into the characters' backstories and goals, allowing the characters to explore their personal narratives within the context of the larger story. For example, if a character seeks to avenge a loved one, introduce a lead that could point them towards the perpetrator.
4.  **Integrate character-driven scenes**: Incorporate scenes and encounters that specifically address the characters' backgrounds and motivations, allowing them to make meaningful progress towards their goals. These scenes should contribute to the overall narrative while also spotlighting individual characters.
5.  **Balance individual and group focus**: Ensure that each character receives an appropriate amount of attention and focus, while also maintaining a cohesive group dynamic and overarching narrative. It is essential to strike a balance between character-driven scenes and those that advance the main plot.

In summary, weaving character backstories and personal goals into your game can significantly enhance the players' connection to the story and their characters. By familiarizing yourself with the characters' backgrounds, identifying their goals, creating plot hooks, integrating character-driven scenes, and balancing individual and group focus, you can create a rich, engaging, and immersive narrative experience for your players.

### 4.5 Integrating Subplots in Larger Plots

Subplots are secondary storylines that add depth and variety to your roleplaying game, enriching the overall narrative. They can provide opportunities for character development and exploration of the game world, making the experience more engaging for the players. Successfully integrating subplots into larger plots requires careful planning and attention to the overall story structure.

When integrating subplots, consider the following tips:

1.  **Identify natural connections**: Look for ways in which your subplots can tie into the main storyline, such as shared themes, character motivations, or setting elements. This helps to create a more cohesive and interconnected narrative.
    
2.  **Balance focus and pacing**: While it's important to give subplots room to unfold, make sure they don't overshadow the main plot. Distribute subplots evenly throughout the story and adjust their pacing to maintain a balance between main and secondary storylines.
    
3.  **Use subplots for character development**: Subplots are an excellent opportunity to delve deeper into your player characters' backstories, motivations, and personal goals. Craft subplots that challenge the characters and provide them with opportunities for growth and development.
    
4.  **Allow subplots to evolve**: As the main plot progresses, subplots may evolve or change direction based on the players' actions and choices. Be flexible and allow subplots to adapt to the shifting narrative, as this can create a more dynamic and engaging story.
    

By carefully considering these points, you can effectively integrate subplots into your larger plots, creating a rich and engaging narrative that keeps your players invested in the story.
