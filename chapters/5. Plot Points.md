## 5. Plot Points

Plot points are the critical moments and events that drive a story forward in a roleplaying game, connecting the various elements of your narrative, such as conflicts and the Story Circle. They provide players with opportunities for meaningful choices, challenges, and character growth, while serving as milestones that shape the narrative and create a memorable gaming experience.

Unlike conflicts, which primarily represent opposing forces and stakes, plot points can include a wide range of events and moments in the story. These may encompass character introductions, key decisions, major conflicts, and climactic battles. When designing your campaign, adventure, or session, it's essential to identify the plot points that will guide your players through the story and keep them engaged.

To create plot points, consider the following:

-   The story's primary conflict and how it unfolds over time
-   Moments of character development, including personal revelations, growth, or setbacks
-   Choices that impact the story's direction and the consequences of those choices
-   Encounters or challenges that test the players' skills and resourcefulness
-   Twists and surprises that keep the story fresh and engaging

By incorporating plot points into your roleplaying game, you provide a solid structure for your narrative, helping you create a cohesive and engaging story that your players will remember long after the game has ended.

### 5.1. Which are the plot points in a story circle in the context of roleplaying games

Plot points in a roleplaying game can be categorized into three types: Feel, Decide, and Act. Each type represents a different aspect of the player characters' journey, emphasizing emotional reactions, decision-making, and actions that drive the story forward. The Game Master should design scenarios that present these plot points to the players, allowing them to engage with the story. Here's the revised list of plot points in the Story Circle, highlighting the three types and providing examples:

1. **Feel the need** (Feel - You to Need): Player characters recognize a problem or desire that motivates them to take action (e.g., discovering a village threatened by an evil sorcerer).
2. **Decide to embark on the journey** (Decide - Need to Go): Player characters make a conscious decision to engage with the story and pursue their goal (e.g., choosing to confront the sorcerer and save the village).
3. **Act on the journey** (Act - Go to Search): Player characters actively work towards their goal, overcoming obstacles and challenges along the way (e.g., battling monsters and solving puzzles).
4. **Feel the surprise after finding what they were looking for** (Feel - Search to Find): Player characters discover something unexpected or experience a twist in the story (e.g., uncovering the sorcerer's tragic backstory).
5. **Decide on a critical choice** (Decide - Find to Take): Player characters face a pivotal decision that will determine the outcome of the story (e.g., deciding whether to show mercy to the sorcerer or bring them to justice).
6. **Act on the showdown** (Act - Take to Return): Player characters engage in a climactic confrontation or decisive action that resolves the main conflict (e.g., defeating the sorcerer and restoring peace to the village).

### 5.2. How to create plot points from conflicts

Creating plot points from conflicts can be a challenging but rewarding part of storytelling in roleplaying games. The key is to use the conflict as the foundation for the story circle, developing engaging plot points that drive the narrative forward. In this chapter, we'll guide you through the process of crafting plot points from conflicts.

1. **Identify the conflict:** Start by selecting a conflict from your conflict table. Consider the type, category, and stakes of the conflict, as these will help you determine the appropriate scope and scale of the story circle. 
2. **Determine the stakes:** Review the stakes of the conflict to understand the potential consequences for the involved parties. The stakes will play a significant role in shaping the player characters' motivations and actions throughout the story circle. 
3. **Outline the six plot points:** Using the conflict as a starting point, create six plot points that correspond to the elements of the story circle. Remember to focus on what the player characters must do to move the plot forward. The six plot points should include: 
    - **Feel the Need:** Player characters become aware of the conflict and the stakes involved, motivating them to take action.
    - **Decide to Embark:** Player characters make a conscious choice to engage with the conflict and accept the responsibility or challenge it presents.
    - **Act on the Journey:** Player characters actively work to address the conflict, taking actions that have a direct impact on the situation.
    - **Feel the Surprise:** Player characters encounter an unexpected twist or revelation that changes their understanding of the conflict or its stakes.
    - **Decide on a Critical Choice:** Player characters face a difficult decision that will determine the outcome of the conflict or influence their approach to resolving it.
    - **Act on the Showdown:** Player characters participate in a climactic confrontation or resolution, ultimately bringing the conflict to a close.
4. **Develop the plot points:** Flesh out the details of each plot point, considering how they connect to the conflict and the actions of the player characters. Be mindful of the decisions, actions, and emotions involved at each step of the story circle. 
5. **Consider player agency:** As you develop the plot points, think about how player characters might react to the conflict and its stakes. Give them opportunities to influence the narrative and make meaningful choices that impact the outcome of the conflict. 
6. **Revise as needed:** After creating the plot points, review the overall narrative and ensure it aligns with the conflict, stakes, and character motivations. Be prepared to revise the plot points as necessary, particularly if the players' actions or decisions deviate from the initial plan. 

By following these steps, you can create engaging plot points from conflicts and craft a compelling story circle for your roleplaying game. Remember that the story circle is a flexible tool and can be adapted to suit the unique needs and preferences of your game and players.

One of the most important things a storyteller must do is to make the player characters feel the need to embark on a journey. Instead of simply offering plot hooks, you should make the player characters feel the need to participate in the adventure. This can be achieved by knowing your players and their characters, understanding their motivations, and offering them something they want or need. Focus on crafting a compelling call to action that resonates with the player characters, and you'll find them more willing to engage with your story.
