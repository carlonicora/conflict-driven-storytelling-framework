## 3. Understanding Conflicts

Conflicts are an essential element of storytelling, as they create tension, drive character development, and propel the narrative forward. In tabletop roleplaying games, conflicts can take many forms and be incorporated into various aspects of the game, such as character creation, worldbuilding, and encounters. By understanding the various types of conflicts and how they can be integrated into a story, GMs can create engaging and dynamic experiences for their players.

Internal conflicts involve a struggle within a character's mind or emotions, such as grappling with a moral dilemma or overcoming personal fears. For example, a paladin might struggle to reconcile their loyalty to a corrupt organization with their personal sense of justice. External conflicts, on the other hand, arise from outside forces or circumstances, such as battling a fearsome monster or navigating a treacherous political landscape. In this case, the party could face a powerful villain who threatens the stability of the entire realm.

Both internal and external conflicts can add depth and complexity to a story, challenging players to make meaningful decisions and explore the consequences of their actions. As a GM, understanding and utilizing these types of conflicts can help you craft immersive narratives that keep your players invested and entertained throughout the game.

### 3.1. Internal Conflicts

Internal conflicts are the emotional and psychological struggles that characters face within themselves, which can add depth to their development and create a richer roleplaying experience for the players. They can manifest as personal dilemmas, moral quandaries, or emotional turmoil.

For example, a rogue in the party might be torn between their loyalty to their friends and their desire for personal gain, leading them to question whether they should betray the group to obtain a powerful artifact. Another example could be a cleric struggling with a crisis of faith after witnessing the suffering of innocent people, causing them to question the teachings of their deity.

As a GM, you can introduce and facilitate internal conflicts by:

1.  Collaborating with players during character creation to identify potential sources of internal conflict based on their characters' backgrounds, beliefs, and motivations.
2.  Presenting morally ambiguous situations or decisions during gameplay, which force characters to confront their internal conflicts and make difficult choices.
3.  Encouraging players to explore their characters' internal conflicts through roleplaying, introspection, and character development.

By incorporating internal conflicts into your game, you can create engaging stories that challenge players to engage with their characters' emotional and psychological complexities, making for a more immersive and rewarding experience.

### 3.2. External Conflicts

External conflicts are the obstacles and challenges that characters face from external sources, such as antagonists, the environment, or social structures. These conflicts drive the plot forward, often serving as the basis for the main storyline and various subplots in a roleplaying game.

Examples of external conflicts include:

1.  Antagonists: A powerful villain threatens the safety of the realm, and the characters must work together to thwart their evil plans.
2.  Environment: The characters are trapped in a harsh wilderness and must survive its many perils to find a way home.
3.  Social Structures: A corrupt government oppresses its people, and the characters must navigate political intrigue to bring about change.

As a GM, you can use external conflicts to create engaging encounters and plot hooks by:

1.  Designing challenging encounters that force the characters to confront external threats and overcome obstacles, such as a battle against a formidable foe or a race against time to prevent a disaster.
2.  Integrating environmental challenges into the game world that test the characters' resourcefulness, such as navigating a treacherous mountain pass or surviving a deadly sandstorm.
3.  Crafting complex social and political conflicts that require the characters to navigate relationships, alliances, and power dynamics to achieve their goals.

By incorporating a variety of external conflicts into your game, you can create a dynamic and engaging story that keeps players invested in the narrative and encourages them to work together to overcome challenges.

### 3.3. Creating Conflicts

Creating conflicts is an essential aspect of building an engaging narrative for your roleplaying game. As a GM, you will need to develop conflicts that challenge your players, encourage them to work together, and connect with their characters' motivations. To create compelling conflicts, consider using the following Conflict structure and guidelines:

-   **Name**: This is a descriptive name for the conflict, which should help players and the storyteller remember what it's about.
-   **Description**: A description of the conflict, including how the player characters are involved.
-   **Type**: This identifies whether the conflict is at the campaign, adventure, or episode level, and helps to contextualize the conflict within the overall story. (campaign, side, session, adventure)
-   **Category**: This is a broad category that helps to describe the nature of the conflict, such as ambition, betrayal, survival, and so on. (ambition, betrayal, survival, revenge, ideology, love, guilt, fear)
-   **Stakes**: This describes what's at stake in the conflict, and what will happen if one side wins over the other. (life and death, love and relationships, power and control, reputation and honor, wealth and resources, freedom and justice, knowledge and information, morality and ethics, beliefs and values, future and legacy)
-   **Opposing Forces**: This identifies the sides of the conflict.
-   **Status**: This tracks the current state of the conflict for the players. (planned, active, pending, resolved)
-   **Events**: This lists the major events that have occurred as part of the conflict, and helps to build the narrative of the conflict.
-   **Involvement**: This describes how the player characters are connected to the conflict. (active, passive, unaware, forced, opportunistic)
-   **Outcome**: The ultimate outcome of the conflict, after the conflict is played out.

When creating conflicts, consider the following guidelines:

1.  **Relevance**: Design conflicts that relate to the player characters' motivations, backstories, or personal goals. This will make the conflicts more engaging and meaningful to the players.
2.  **Balance**: Ensure that conflicts are challenging but not overwhelming. Adjust the difficulty and complexity of conflicts based on the players' experience and the characters' abilities.
3.  **Variety**: Create a mix of conflicts that involve different categories and types. This will keep the game fresh and interesting for the players.

By using this structure and following these guidelines, you can ensure that your conflicts are well-developed, engaging, and effectively integrated into your game. This will allow your players to become more invested in the story and encourage them to think creatively about how to overcome challenges.

### 3.4. Conflict Evolution and Resolution

Conflicts in a roleplaying game naturally evolve as the story progresses and player characters make choices. As a storyteller, it's essential to understand how conflicts change and how to bring them to a meaningful resolution. In this section, we will discuss the different stages of conflict evolution and provide guidance on resolving conflicts in a way that enhances the overall narrative and highlights the players' impact on the story.

**Stages of Conflict Evolution:**

1. Introduction: At this stage, the conflict is introduced into the story. The players may become aware of the conflict, or it may be something happening behind the scenes that will eventually affect them.
2. Escalation: As the story unfolds, the conflict may escalate in intensity, involving more characters or becoming more complex. This stage often includes twists and turns that keep the players engaged and curious.
3. Climax: The climax is the turning point in the conflict when the outcome is determined. It is usually the most intense and dramatic part of the story, where the players face the ultimate challenge or make a pivotal decision.
4. Resolution: Finally, the conflict is resolved, and the consequences of the players' actions and choices become apparent. This stage may also include a reflection on the lessons learned and the impact of the conflict on the characters and the world.

**Resolving Conflicts:**

1. Consider the players' choices: The resolution of a conflict should be a direct result of the players' choices, whether they were successful or not. This reinforces the idea that their decisions have consequences and impact the story. 
2. Aim for a satisfying conclusion: A satisfying resolution ties up loose ends, answers questions, and provides closure. However, it's essential to strike a balance between providing closure and leaving some room for future stories and character development. 
3. Emphasize character growth: Conflicts offer opportunities for character growth and development. The resolution should demonstrate how the conflict has affected the characters and what they've learned from the experience. 
4. Incorporate consequences: Conflicts often have far-reaching consequences, both positive and negative. The resolution should explore these consequences and how they shape the world and the characters moving forward. 
5. 1.  Be adaptable: Sometimes, players may find unexpected solutions or take actions that don't align with your initial plans. Be flexible and open to adapting the conflict's resolution to fit the choices and actions of the players, keeping the story dynamic and engaging.
